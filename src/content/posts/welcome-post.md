### console.log('Hello World')

This is the first post of my new blog called Code of Power
Here i will post my thoughts and try to use it to spread my infinite widsom :-)

### Why?

The main reason i wanted to create my little personal space is actually to play with Astro framework. But, apart from that, i also think that i've gained a lot of knowledge over the years and i have the feeling that grows inside me that i should start sharing

### What?

So, i mentioned what a well of knowledge I am.
My interest mostly comes down to geopolitics and IT in general. In my free time i also play some games but i'm really bad so i doubt i will write anything here about it :d

### How?

I will write rather short articles. I'm unsure how all of this will work out, but i value very consised knowledge. I of course don't plan to skip some details but I will definitely skip meaningless sentences.

### Testing MD

I just want to test some MD elements, see if there will be need to implement MDX

1. code blocks
2. quotes
3. highlight

```js
const welcome = (name: string): void => {
  console.log(`Hi, ${name}!`);
  console.log('Just testing code blocks');
};
```
